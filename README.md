# Infection
Adds support for the infection game mode to ManiaControl. Currently this is only the //infect command.
## Setup
### Requirements
No other plugins are required, just a ManiaPlanet server with <a href="http://maniacontrol.com">ManiaControl</a>.
Infection runs fine with ManiaControl v0.162 but should also work with any newer version.
### Installation
To install this you can use ManiaControls plugin manager or download the php file and drop it into "[ManiaControl]/plugins/mewin/". If the folder does not exist, create it.
## Usage
### Permissions
This plugin adds one new permission which can be configured using the ManiaControl settings panel:
* "Infect player" - Select which users are allowed to use the //infect command.

### Commands
* "//infect <login>" - Infect the player with the specified login.

## License
Infection is licensed under the GPLv3, see LICENSE for more information.
